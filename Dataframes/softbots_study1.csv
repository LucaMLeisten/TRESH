Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","baxter","1","31","41","57","65","49","63","66","64","51","49","34","37","46","51","50","59","6","11","11","11","9","11","9","11","4","10","4","12","4","28","18","31","26","Nothing","0","0","1","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher.

Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","cozmo","1","52","54","45","47","49","51","48","48","49","43","14","15","46","52","55","48","7","10","12","10","10","10","5","5","5","6","9","4","6","60","51","68","56","Nothing","0","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","nao","1","51","51","55","53","55","61","64","63","63","52","33","38","49","60","54","59","5","7","10","8","11","6","11","6","2","1","8","7","8","75","71","72","66","Teach science","0","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","pepper","1","47","53","77","69","76","81","78","80","74","77","83","83","62","52","48","81","9","12","7","9","12","12","3","2","3","7","6","11","11","68","63","70","63","Teach science","0","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","blossom","2","47","56","68","58","62","69","69","69","65","53","45","49","49","56","54","68","11","5","4","4","8","8","4","3","9","9","1","6","7","73","75","75","78","Sing songs","1","0","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Danke, dass Sie diese Studie durchführen und den Roboter-Einsatz im Schulzimmer damit beschleunigen. Ich denke, es braucht noch eine ganze Weile, bis das kommt.
Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Studie!
Das hat doch länger gedauert hier mitzumachen, als ich dachte. Beachten Sie das bitte, wenn Sie die Daten auswerten, dass wir viel dazu beigetragen haben. Das ist nicht nichts, sondern Lebenszeit, die auch wir in Ihre Studie gesteckt haben und nichts dafür erhalten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass Sie damit sorgfältig umgehen und fleissig am Auswerten sind.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","miro","1","58","56","63","59","60","58","60","56","62","58","59","62","59","61","61","58","4","2","5","5","2","5","2","9","11","5","2","8","10","71","72","79","75","Notning","0","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students.

This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","paro","2","57","59","66","62","70","75","81","78","78","39","19","19","44","59","59","79","12","9","8","12","5","4","12","4","7","2","10","9","12","70","80","79","82","Read fairytales","1","0","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","tofu","2","55","64","74","75","75","79","79","81","80","46","12","12","60","68","57","79","2","3","6","6","4","2","6","12","12","11","5","1","3","81","74","81","79","Sing songs","1","0","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","tega","2","53","57","51","55","53","64","62","66","61","57","55","53","53","57","53","63","10","6","9","7","6","9","10","8","8","8","12","5","2","86","81","86","84","Read fairytales","1","0","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","huggable","2","54","58","61","62","61","66","63","64","63","60","58","60","61","61","55","64","8","8","3","2","3","3","8","10","6","4","7","3","9","74","79","75","81","Read fairytales","1","0","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","moxy","1","72","77","93","93","93","93","94","92","93","93","94","95","92","87","82","93","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","7","1","3","3","10","1","80","77","81","79","Nothing","1","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.

Suppose students become overly dependent on robots for learning and support. In that case, they may miss out on valuable interactions with human teachers and peers, which are essential for social and emotional development.","Ethical Concerns: The use of social robots in education raises various ethical concerns, including issues related to privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. There is a risk that sensitive student data collected by robots could be compromised or misused, leading to privacy violations or discrimination. Additionally, if social robots are not designed and programmed with careful consideration of ethical principles, they could perpetuate biases or stereotypes in their interactions with students.","","Human-Robot Collaboration: Rather than replacing human educators, social robots could be designed to complement and support the work of teachers in the classroom. By fostering collaboration between human teachers and robots, educators can ensure that students receive a balanced learning experience that incorporates the benefits of both human and artificial intelligence.","Ethical Guidelines and Oversight: Development and implementation of clear ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of social robots in education are essential for safeguarding student privacy, data security, and fairness. Educators, policymakers, and technology developers should work together to establish and enforce ethical standards for social robot design, deployment, and use in educational settings.","","Personalized Learning: Social robots can adapt their interactions based on the individual needs and preferences of students. Through data collection and analysis, they can tailor content and pacing to suit each student's learning style, thereby providing a more personalized learning experience.","","","Collaboration between Educators and Technologists: Educators and technologists need to collaborate closely to ensure that social robots are designed and programmed to align with educational goals and pedagogical principles. This collaboration can involve educators providing insights into learning objectives and instructional strategies, while technologists contribute their expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence.","","","Social robots can be utilized in various educational contexts and activities, including:

Personalized Learning Support: Social robots can provide personalized learning support to students by adapting to their individual learning styles, preferences, and pace. For example, robots could assist students with homework assignments, provide additional explanations or practice exercises tailored to their needs, and offer real-time feedback and encouragement to enhance their understanding and mastery of academic concepts.

Interactive Learning Experiences: Social robots can facilitate interactive learning experiences that engage students in hands-on activities, simulations, and educational games. For instance, robots could lead interactive storytelling sessions, guide students through virtual experiments or simulations, and facilitate collaborative problem-solving tasks that promote critical thinking and creativity.

Social and Emotional Skills Development: Social robots can support the development of social and emotional skills in students by providing opportunities for practice and reinforcement in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. For example, robots could engage students in role-playing scenarios to help them practice effective communication, conflict resolution, and empathy skills. Additionally, robots could serve as social companions or mentors, providing emotional support and encouragement to students as they navigate academic challenges and transitions.","keepon","2","57","61","60","60","63","68","67","70","66","58","24","24","60","62","59","66","3","4","2","3","7","7","7","1","10","12","11","2","5","69","67","70","69","Sing songs","1","1","0","I prefer the animals for the children because when I use them as puppets during my lessons, they love them.

Not an awful problem, it'd be amusing at first but not for long!","I do wonder what our children with additional support needs like ASD would make of it. I can see it going either way- relations with other children would be shunned in favour of communicating with the robot as the lack of human emotion might be preferable to them. Or the opposite- they would be afraid of the robot and shun it, refusing to look at it or interact with it.","","These are Primary school age children, easily distracted, but I think if the use of robots was limited in the way that use of Ipads and laptops is limited, I mean used for certain lessons but not all, it could be an incentive rather than a problem. They'd know when the robots would be used and learn not to ask for them all the time. Of course, if they were a constant feature in the classroom, the children would just get used to them and it wouldn't be a novelty any more. getting to that stage would be a nightmare though!","The children would spend time with their Pupil Support Worker outside the classroom, perhaps in our safe space room, just sitting and watching the robots for a while and this stage should continue for some time to judge their reactions. We might be pleasantly surprised. Only once we felt the children were comfortable at least, should they be introduced into the classroom setting. We might even have to schedule sessions in class with the rest of the students so that their most boisterous reactions were over before all the children were present at the same time as the robot.","","I do think it could be beneficial in that, once the initial hysteria was over, the children would be keen to interact with the robot and integrate its use into their learning. Primary age children do love a novelty but at the same time, are usually pretty tech savvy so it'd be very interesting to see the different ideas they'd come up with to utilise the robot. I think that's something we would run with and it would expand the boundaries of how we envisaged the robots being used.","As I said in the previous section, I can see it going one of two ways with the children with additional support needs. I'd like to think, however, that they might actually find it as easy if not easier, to form a connection at their own level, with a robot. It would take away the need to watch out for nuanced reactions which they don't fully understand and know in which way to react. I also think that educationally, it might be easier for them to seek and get advice from a robot instead of one of their peers, where it can be uncomfortable for them, not quite knowing how to ask for help.","","","","","I think it would be a fun but potentially useful first stage in learning social skills for our additional support needs children. There would be no pressure in gauging responses and responding in kind but would be an excellent way to practice. It would probably be our Pupil Support Workers (our Council's name for Teaching Assistants) who would lead this as they generally run our social skills and health and wellbeing groups.
I a classroom setting, the robots could spot children who were struggling, ask what help was needed and report to the teacher. I don't know if we're talking here about robots who could provide educational support too? That would be good too as there are never enough adults present, even with a PSW in the class, to deal with all the queries, especially in the younger Primary classes.
